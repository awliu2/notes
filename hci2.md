# Usability Heuristics and Errors

## 1. Visibility of System Status

UI should keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time

* i.e loading screens/bars

## 2. Match between system and real world

Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in natural,logical order

* i.e macOS trash icon
* taking something from real world and mimicking on UI is called a *metaphor*
* skeuomorphism: copying the real world into your interface

## 3. User control and freedom
    
Users often make mistakes and will want ways to go back, i.e give people a way to undo/redo, confirm actions, etc

* dark ui design: when designers purposely make something hard to do in order to again control over the user

## 4. Consistency

Users should not have to wonder what something does in different contexts.

## 5. Mental Modles

What users believe about your system

* a model of what users know (or think they know)
* they user this model to predict their actions on your system
    * their experiences shape their expectations
    * i.e "yes" on left, "no" on right
    * UI projects certain possibilites onto the user


## Affordance
* refers to the perceived and actual properties of the thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used. - Don Norman

* tldr: how well-designed objects communicate use.
